The purpose of this program is to create a simple yet effective software 
to manage a seating arrangement for an upcoming party, represented using 
the class Party. A database of guests, represented using the Party class, 
is loaded in via .txt file. This includes their seating arrangements, 
company names, positions at a certain table, and more. The user is allowed 
to manually register guests at the conference, search the roster for a 
certain guest, and look up rosters by company and table numbers.
